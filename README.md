# manipedClientCustomerDesktop

Sharing economy meets the cosmetics industry.

This is the desktop React app for customers.  

Project was done in the months after my coding bootcamp before next employment opportunity was started. I discontinued it because of 2 things:

1: Business reasons.

2: I learned all the things I did wrong at my next job which was solely building React, and React-Native apps from scratch in a constant time crunch for very picky clients.

Frontend for customers on web is here, and the provider client React app (barely started) and the REST API are also pinned to my homepage. Styling is horrendous on the frontend so beware; I'm not a designer, and spun those up just for show after I had decided to quit the project.
